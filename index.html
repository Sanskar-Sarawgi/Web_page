    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>It's a great app for kids. It keeps track of everything the child does including the amount of time spent in different apps and when settings are changed. It's safe when I can mess around in the kitchen and still keep my kids safe from toxic things.</p>
    <p>While Microsoft Family and Google Family Link work just fine, they are restricted to their own companies. Mobicip bridges the gap by applying the same settings per person on any device it has been installed on. Simple to setup, easy to use, and quite informative on your child's activities.</p>
